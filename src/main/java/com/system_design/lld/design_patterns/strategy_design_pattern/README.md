Let's break down the Strategy Design Pattern in a simple way, with an easy example and a visual representation.

1. What is the Strategy Pattern?

   The Strategy Pattern lets you define a family of algorithms (or strategies) and make them interchangeable at runtime.  Instead of hardcoding a specific behavior into your class, you can choose which algorithm to use dynamically.  This makes your code more flexible and easier to maintain.

2. Analogy:

   Imagine you're traveling. You might choose different modes of transportation (strategies) depending on the distance, cost, and your preferences: walking, taking a bus, or flying in a plane.  The Strategy Pattern is like having a system that can dynamically choose the best transportation strategy for your trip.

3. Benefits of the Strategy Pattern:

   a. Flexibility: You can easily add new strategies without modifying the Order class.
   
   b. Maintainability: The code is more organized and easier to understand. Each strategy is encapsulated in its own class.
   
   c. Reusability: Strategies can be reused in other parts of your application.
   
   d. Open/Closed Principle: You can add new strategies without modifying existing code.
   
This example demonstrates the core idea of the Strategy Pattern. You can apply it to various situations where you need to choose between different algorithms or behaviors at runtime.  Remember to adapt the example to your specific needs and programming language.

5. APIs in the example:

   a. api: /lld/design-pattern/strategy-design-pattern/shipping
   
   b. payload (values of properties can be changed): Array of {name, price}

   ex.

   		[
   			{
   				"name": "Show Piece",
   				"price": 300
   			},
   			{
   				"name": "Wall Paper",
   				"price": 1000
   			},
   			{
   				"name": "Door Mat",
   				"price": 100
   			}
   		]
   
   c. query params: shippingMode=one-day || shippingMode=express || shippingMode=null
   
   d. url preview:

	  i. shippingMode=one-day:
   
         http://localhost:8080/lld/design-pattern/observer-design-pattern/?shippingMode=one-day
   
     ii. shippingMode=express:
   
          http://localhost:8080/lld/design-pattern/observer-design-pattern/?shippingMode=express
   
     iii. shippingMode=null:
   
           http://localhost:8080/lld/design-pattern/observer-design-pattern/?shippingMode=null
