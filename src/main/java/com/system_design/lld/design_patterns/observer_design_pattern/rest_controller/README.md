1. What is Observer Design Pattern?

    The Observer pattern is like a notification system.  It lets you have objects (called "subjects") that maintain a list of other objects (called "observers") that depend on them. When the subject's state changes, it automatically notifies all its observers.


2. Analogy:

    Think of a news channel (subject) and its viewers (observers). When the news channel has a breaking story (state change), it informs all its viewers.


3. Example:

    Let's say you have a WeatherData object (subject) that tracks temperature, humidity, and pressure. You have several displays (observers) that show this data.

   1. Subject (WeatherData):
   
        Has methods to set the data and notify observers.  It maintains a list of observers.

   2. Observer (Display): 
   
        Has a method to update its display when notified.
4. Key Points:

    1. Decoupling: Subject and observers don't need to know much about each other. 
   2. Flexibility: You can add or remove observers easily. 
   3. Event Handling: Useful for handling events and notifications.
