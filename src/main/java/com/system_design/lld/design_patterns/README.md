# System Design with Java Spring Boot

This repository is a series of System Design concepts with examples implemented in Java Spring Boot.

## What are Design Patterns?

Design patterns are like reusable blueprints for solving common problems in object-oriented programming (OOP). Think of them as tried-and-tested solutions that experienced developers have come up with over time. Instead of reinventing the wheel every time you encounter a particular problem, you can use a design pattern as a guide to structure your code in a clean, efficient, and maintainable way.

### Key Characteristics:
- **Solutions to Recurring Problems**: They address common challenges in software design, like object creation, managing relationships between objects, and handling changes flexibly.
- **Not Code, but Blueprints**: They are abstract descriptions of how to solve a problem, which you then adapt to your specific situation.
- **Improve Code Quality**: They promote good design principles (like SOLID), making code more readable, reusable, and maintainable.
- **A Shared Vocabulary**: They provide a common language for developers to discuss design issues. For example, saying "I'm thinking of using the Strategy pattern here" makes it easier for other developers to understand your approach.

## Why Use Design Patterns?

- **Save Time and Effort**: No need to solve common problems from scratch.
- **Improve Code Readability**: Code that follows well-known patterns is easier to understand.
- **Increase Code Reusability**: Patterns often lead to more modular and reusable code.
- **Make Code More Flexible**: Helps in designing systems that are easier to extend or modify in the future.

### A Simple Analogy:
Imagine you're building with LEGOs. A design pattern is like a set of instructions for building a specific thing, like a car or a house. Without instructions, it would take longer, and the result might not be stable. The instructions (the design pattern) provide a proven way to build something effectively.

## Example: The Singleton Pattern

### Problem:
Sometimes, you need to ensure that only one instance of a particular class exists in your entire application. Examples include database connections or configuration managers, where multiple instances could cause conflicts.

### Solution (Singleton Pattern):
The Singleton pattern provides a way to create a class that can only have one instance and ensures a global point of access to that instance.

### Analogy:
Imagine there's only one principal at a school. The Singleton pattern ensures that everyone in the school knows who the principal is and prevents the possibility of multiple principals.

## Types of Design Patterns

Design patterns are categorized into three main groups:

1. **Creational Patterns**: Deal with object creation strategies (e.g., Singleton, Factory, Builder).
2. **Structural Patterns**: Focus on how objects are composed to form larger structures (e.g., Adapter, Decorator, Composite).
3. **Behavioral Patterns**: Define how objects interact and distribute responsibilities (e.g., Strategy, Observer, Command).

## Learning Design Patterns

The best way to learn design patterns is to start with a few common ones and understand how they work. Over time, you'll recognize which patterns apply to different problems in your own projects. There are many great resources online and in books that can help deepen your understanding.

### Tips for Learning:
- Don't try to memorize all patterns at once.
- Focus on core ideas and when to apply them.
- With practice, you'll become more comfortable using design patterns to create better software.
